# dog_rating

The weRateDogs twitter page is a platform that rates people’s dog, adding humorous comments to it. I ventured to analyse extracted data from this page in continuation of the Udacity data analysis nanodegree program. I was involved in the data wrangling project. The project tested students’ ability to go through the different data wrangling stages which include gathering, assessing and cleaning data.
